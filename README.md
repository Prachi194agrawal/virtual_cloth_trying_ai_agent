# GrocLake Integration Example

This repository demonstrates the integration of GrocLake, a data management solution for handling e-commerce product catalogs and data processing.

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of GrocLake modules for managing product catalogs, data, vectors, and models. It's designed to handle e-commerce product data with comprehensive features for data processing and management.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

## Installation

Install required packages
pip install groclake==0.1.14
pip install opencv-python-headless mediapipe matplotlib
text

## Project Structure

The project consists of four key components:

- **CatalogLake**: Manages product catalog data
- **DataLake**: Handles data storage and retrieval
- **VectorLake**: Processes vector operations
- **ModelLake**: Manages machine learning models

## Setup and Configuration

1. Set environment variables:
os.environ['GROCLAKE_ACCOUNT_ID']='your_account_id'
os.environ['GROCLAKE_API_KEY']='your_api_key'
text

2. Initialize GrocLake modules:
from groclake.cataloglake import CatalogLake
from groclake.datalake import DataLake
from groclake.vectorlake import VectorLake
from groclake.modellake import ModelLake
cataloglake = CatalogLake()
datalake = DataLake()
vectorlake = VectorLake()
modellake = ModelLake()
text

## Features

- Product catalog management
- Data processing and analysis
- Vector operations support
- Model integration capabilities
- Image processing functionality
- Comprehensive product information handling

## Data Structure

The system manages various product attributes including:

- Product IDs and SKUs
- Category hierarchies
- Product descriptions
- Inventory management
- Pricing information
- Image URLs and assets
- Custom product attributes

## Supported Product Categories

The implementation handles various product types including:

- Apparel (Clothing, Accessories)
- Footwear
- Personal Care Items
- Accessories (Watches, Bags, etc.)
- Sports Equipment

## Example Usage

Initialize catalog
cataloglake = CatalogLake()
Fetch product data
products = cataloglake.get_products()
Process inventory
inventory = datalake.get_inventory()
Perform vector operations
vectors = vectorlake.process_data()

## Security Notes

- Replace `your_account_id` and `your_api_key` with actual GrocLake credentials
- Implement proper error handling in production environments
- Follow security best practices for API key management
- Keep credentials secure and never commit them to version control
